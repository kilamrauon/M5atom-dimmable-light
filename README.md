# M5atom-dimmable-light

Simple project (2 minutes) with and M5atom  Matrixand an arduino module k-018 (https://arduinomodules.info/ky-018-photoresistor-module/).
Just plug the module in the M5atom and upload the code, the M5atom matrix will be brighter as the light decreases.
5 led brightness and 5 different colors (changing color by clicking the screen)


I have encountered several problems with the leds:
The screen has stange beahviour with some colors (especially with some predefined colors) and is white when the brightness is at 5. don't know why
